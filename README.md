Description:
The program is designed to manage transactions, such as expenses and incomes. It allows the user to add, delete transactions, and generate reports about them.
Goals:
To create a program through which the user can manage transactions, view them, and obtain detailed information about each transaction.

Documentation:
The purpose of the project is to create a program that enables transaction management, including adding, deleting, and generating reports about transactions. It was decided to create a simple program as more complex solutions are challenging.

The code utilizes classes and functions to structure and manage transactions. Two main functions allow the user to input transaction data (addTransaction) and view details of all transactions (generateReport). To use the software, the user simply needs to run the code in any compiler, after which they will be prompted to enter transaction details including date, amount, category, and description.
